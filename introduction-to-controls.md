# Introduction to Controls

## Why Controls?

*Control theory* is a field of engineering that deals with designing controllers (typically implemented in software) to move a system to the desired state. Some systems are easy to control, some are difficult to control, and some are even impossible to control. Knowing which systems to design for and implementing a controller for them is a crucial skill that proves useful in many real-world jobs. It enables your robot to perform more reliably and efficiently. Implementing robust controls in your robot not only improves autonomous performance but also provides the peace of mind that your robot will behave as expected.
