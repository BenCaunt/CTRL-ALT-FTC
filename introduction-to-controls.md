# Why Control Theory is a Must Have

## Why Controls?

Control Theory is a field of engineering that deals with designing controllers \(typically implemented in software\) that move our system to the desired state. Some systems are easy to control, some are difficult to control, some are even impossible to control. Knowing what systems to design for and implementing a controller for them is a crucial skill that is useful in many real-world industries and will allow your robot to perform more reliably and efficiently. Having robust controls implemented into your robot will allow you to score higher in autonomous and provide peace of mind that your robot will behave you expect.
